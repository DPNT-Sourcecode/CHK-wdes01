ROUND 1 - Hello world

This challenge is part of the warmup and will introduce you to the concept of penalties.

Similar to this challenge, the official challenge will consist of multiple rounds with evolving
requirements.
The goal is to complete all rounds as quickly as possible, with the timer running continuously between
rounds.

Deploying an incomplete or buggy implementation will frustrate your customers and result in costs. This
is simulated through penalties.

When your implementation fails in production, youâ€™ll receive a 10-minute penalty, along with some
feedback.

Sometimes, the requirements are unclear. Getting feedback from your users may be the key to moving
forward.

The requirement for this round is to say hello to the world. (I know, it's not well defined.)

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:

hello(string) -> string
 - param[0] = a String containing a name
 - @return = a String containing a message
