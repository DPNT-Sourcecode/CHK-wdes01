ROUND 3 - More items and offers
A new item has arrived. Item F.
Our marketing team wants to try rewording the offer to see if it affects consumption
Instead of multi-pricing this item they want to say "buy 2Fs and get another F free"
The offer requires you to have 3 Fs in the basket.

Our price table and offers:
+------+-------+------------------------+
| Item | Price | Special offers         |
+------+-------+------------------------+
| A    | 50    | 3A for 130, 5A for 200 |
| B    | 30    | 2B for 45              |
| C    | 20    |                        |
| D    | 15    |                        |
| E    | 40    | 2E get one B free      |
| F    | 10    | 2F get one F free      |
+------+-------+------------------------+


Notes:
 - The policy of the supermarket is to always favor the customer when applying special offers.
 - Offers involving multiple items always give a better discount than offers containing fewer items.
 - For any illegal input return -1

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:

checkout(string) -> integer
 - param[0] = a string containing the SKUs of all the products in the basket
 - @return = an integer representing the total checkout value of the items
