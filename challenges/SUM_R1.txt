SUM_R1
ROUND 1 - Add two numbers

This simple challenge helps you get familiar with how the system works.

It simulates the typical development cycle:
- Write your code using your device and IDE
- Design your own tests based on the given requirements
- Once you're ready, deploy your software

When you run "deploy to production", your code will start receiving requests as if they were coming
from "real" users.
While the code stays on your laptop, the requests will be sent to your implementation.
You can observe incoming requests and responses in the console.

Your responses are only validated when you type "deploy" on the Server console.
Treat the Server console like your production environment.

For your convenience, a test framework has already been configured for this project.

In order to complete the round you need to implement the following method:

sum(integer, integer) -> integer
 - param[0] = a positive integer between 0-100
 - param[1] = a positive integer between 0-100
 - @return = an integer representing the sum of the two numbers
